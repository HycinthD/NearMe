                    A bus stand, also called a bus bay, or bus stance, is a designated parking location where a bus or coach waits out of service between scheduled public transport services. 'Bus stand' is also often an alternative name for specific bus stops inside a bus station.[1]

Bus stands are seen at different busy spots, like school or college gates, markets, medical centres and the crossing point(s) of two or more roads. A bus stand is usually employed to allow a bus to lay over at a bus terminus, without giving the appearance of being in service, or blocking the stop from use by other buses that are in service. Bus stands also allow short-term parking for driver changes or driver breaks.

In the simplest case, a bus turnout type of bus stop is extended, and buses can lay over away from the stop if necessary. In locations where buses cannot remain stationary for long, nearby but separate bus stands may be provided where other bus parking is not conveniently located.
