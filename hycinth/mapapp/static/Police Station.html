                    police stations are referred to as 'Thana' or 'Thane'. The term "thana" is derived from the Persian word "sthan," which means a place or location. The British colonial administration adopted this term, and it has been widely used ever since. There are regional variations, such as "KƒÅval nilaiyam" in Tamil Nadu, etc. Police stations have a designated area under their jurisdiction. Police stations are headed by a station house officer (SHO) who may be of inspector or sub-inspector rank, assisted by an assistant sub-inspector, head constables, and constables. The number of personnel in a particular police station depend on many factors like area covered, population, topography, crime rate, sensitivity, important places and others. Some police stations may have police outposts under them. Police outposts are set up when areas covered by police stations have difficult topography, a lack of transportation, high population density, communally sensitive places and border points, or if the area is very large.[1] There are many police stations in India which lack basic infrastructure like proper buildings, landline telephones, wireless sets, vehicles, computers and adequate police personnel.[2][3] Specialized police stations also exist for specific purposes, such as cyber crime, railway, traffic enforcement, women, and others.
